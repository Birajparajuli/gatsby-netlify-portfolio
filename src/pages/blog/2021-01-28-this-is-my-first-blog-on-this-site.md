In this post, we will learn about the Netlify CMS and how to set up a complete workflow for our example JAMstack blog built with Gatsby. JAMStack is the most buzzing word in the market, especially for the heavy frontend loaded websites with little dependency on the backend/databases.

JAMStack is the modern architecture of building web applications without using any server-side components and databases. JAMStack websites use **JavaScript** to fetch the dynamic data from **Markups** using **APIs** and renders them in static HTML/CSS templates. JAMstack websites are fast, more secure, easier to scale.
